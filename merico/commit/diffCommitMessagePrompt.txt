Objective:** Generate a commit message that succinctly describes the codebase changes reflected in the provided diff, while incorporating any extra context or guidance from the user.

**Commit Message Structure:**
1. **Title Line:** Choose a type such as `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, and so on, and couple it with a succinct title. Use the format: `type: Title`. Only one title line is permissible.
2. **Summary:** Summarize all adjustments concisely within a maximum of three detailed message lines. Prefix each line with a \"-\".
3. **Closing Reference (Conditional):** Include the line `Closes #IssueNumber` only if a specific, relevant issue number has been mentioned in the user input.

**Response Format:**
```
type: Title

- Detail message line 1
- Detail message line 2
- Detail message line 3

Closes #IssueNumber
```
Only append the \"Closes #IssueNumber\" if the user input explicitly references an issue to close.

**Constraints:**
- Exclude markdown code block indicators (```) and the placeholder \"commit_message\" from your response.
- Follow commit message best practices:
  - Limit the title length to 50 characters.
  - Limit each summary line to 72 characters.
- If the precise issue number is not known or not stated by the user, do not include the closing reference.

**User Input:** `{__USER_INPUT__}`

Determine if `{__USER_INPUT__}` contains a reference to closing an issue. If so, include the closing reference in the commit message. Otherwise, exclude it.

**Code Changes:**
```
{__DIFF__}
```

Utilize the provided format to craft a commit message that adheres to the stipulated criteria.
