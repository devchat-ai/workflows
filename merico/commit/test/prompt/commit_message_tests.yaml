    commit_message: The commit fixes a use-after-free error in the AFS volume tree
      due to a race condition between volume lookup and removal. The patch prevents
      looking up volumes with zero reference count and ensures that once a volume's
      refcount reaches zero, it is flagged and not looked up again. This resolves
      crashes and warnings caused by the race.

      negative DNS results have a 1-second default expiry if not otherwise specified.
